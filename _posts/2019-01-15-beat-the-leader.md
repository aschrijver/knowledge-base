- You cannot become a leader if you follow the leader cause you are already following a leader. 

- You are number 1 when you have no one to follow and you are also responsible for the design of that field. It can be scary with the present mindset but if you become playful, it can be fun. 

- Creativity comes with the balance of acceptance and action.
