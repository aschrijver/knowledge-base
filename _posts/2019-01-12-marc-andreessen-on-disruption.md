A disruptive innovation *gives new consumers access to product historically only available to consumers with a lot of money* or skill.

A new product for a previously underserved market--typically cheaper than existing product.

It's about creation--new products, new choices, for more people

Disruptive innovation shrinks inequality.

Many of the things you own that make your life better are the result of prior disruptive innovation

Disruptive innovation made these things available to many more people
