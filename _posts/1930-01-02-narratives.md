Most venture capitalists aren't original thinkers, but not Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen. The two prestigious venture capitalists had a great debate[1] on business creation I think it's worth to dig in. 

Their disagreement can be viewed through the lens of how they view Twitter. Thiel sees it as "we wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters" (a Founders Fund slogan). He thinks it's an unimpressive, incremental advancement. Andreessen, however, views it as "instant global public messaging for free". In other words, fundamentally transformative.

## Finding vs. Creating

Here are the differences in investing perspectives between Andreessen and Thiel.

- The Game of Finding 

There are lots of rooms in this building(market), and there are lots of treatures(opportunities) in those rooms. You may know how many golds in some rooms, but you won't know when will it open. You need good tools and good timing to open the doors to get those rewards. 

- The Game of Creating

You create another building, another layer of the game. You create new rooms others hard to even find it. Mostly, It's an "unpopular idea" so no one but you want to build it.


### Marc Andreessen: Open at the Right Time

On Marc's philosophy that software is eating the world, and timing is everything. In this game, he thinks the timing is everything. You need to execute your idea within the critical window to succeed. Most importantly, you need to find the right window.

> "The strongest form is that, as a consequence of all this, Silicon Valley-type software companies will end up eating everything. The kinds of companies we build in the Valley will rule pretty much every industry. These companies have software at their very core. They know how to develop software. They know the economics of software. They make engineering the priority. And that’s why they’ll win. All this is reflected in the Andreessen Horowitz investment thesis. We don’t do cleantech or biotech. We do things that are based on software. If software is the heart of the company—if things would collapse if you ripped out your key development team—perfect. The companies that will end up dominating most industries are the ones with the same set of management practices and characteristics that you see at Facebook or Google. It will be a rolling process, of course, and the backlash will be intense. Dinosaurs are not in favor or being replaced by birds."- Marc Andreessen

> "The big, almost philosophical difference goes back to the timing issue. For entrepreneurs, timing is a huge risk. You have to innovate at the right time. You can’t be too early. This is really dangerous because you essentially make a one-time bet. It’s rare are to start the same company five years later if you try it once and were wrong on timing. Jonathan Abrams did Friendster but not Facebook. Things are different with venture capital. To stay in business for 20 years or more, you have to take a portfolio approach. Ideas are no longer one-time bets. If we believe in an idea and back the company that fails at it, it’s probably still a good idea. If someone good wants to do the same thing four years later, that’s probably a good investment. Most VCs won’t do this. They’ll be too scarred from the initial failure. But tracking systematically failures is important." - Marc Andreessen

> But seriously—if you think you can execute on an idea that someone tried 5-10 years ago and failed, good VCs will be open to it. You just have to be able to show that now is the time.- Marc Andreessen*


### Peter Thiel: Create Your Own Door

Is your market big enough? Who cares—create a new one if it isn’t. Peter Thiel argues good innovation sells itself.

> “If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough.”“Technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.” - Peter Thiel, Zero to One

The Founder’s Fund, which Peter Thiel co-founded, has a longer manifesto here that explains in greater detail their investment philosophy on startups.

Peter believes in determinate optimism: the future is made by exceptional people who have a definite plan and execute on it. That meaningful, big-leap innovations are often not obvious from the start: If you're creating something that will be a great company 10 years from now, most people will probably not get it at first. 

In other words: Founders who want to create radical innovation should have a big, audacious plan and ignore mundane thinking.

Peter's logic works well in a long-term view: finding a frontier of value which will be a great company years from now. A frontier that only a few people believe exists (but you have strong proof and conviction that it does). 


## Run Faster vs. Jump Higher

### Higher: Investing for Control

You can term Peter's approach to entrepreneurial strategy: investing for control.

You achieve it by patiently building your business at the same time as ensuring that you will be insulated from future competition. It takes time and it takes investment dollars as resources. Put out some crappy minimum viable product and you lose some options to control because you have shown your hand to others. Instead, what you want to do is put out a complete product with a strategy to acquire the complementary resources to insulate it from future competition. 


There is, however, another sort of monopoly — a path that gets you 100 percent of a real market. This is done by having the capabilities to beat all rivals on either quality or cost. To see how this arises consider a very structurally price-competitive market (in economics, Bertrand competition). Now suppose that you develop an innovation that allows having lower marginal costs than everyone else. In this situation, you will be able to capture 100 percent of the market and so you will be a technical monopoly. 

### Faster: Focusing on finding the timing

You can term Marc's approach to entrepreneurial strategy: focusing on execution(finding the timing). 

It is not so obvious that one path to monopoly is more profitable than the other. If you focus on execution you can get to market quicker and with fewer resources. You can learn as you go and actually invest in the capabilities that will give you a competitive advantage in the future. In other words, while it takes on-going work — no resting on your monopoly laurels here — you can still ‘own’ a market. The difference is that your pricing is constrained by potential competition from other firms. 

Finding the timing is the most important part of the execution. You need to execute your idea fast and good enough within the critical window to succeed. Most importantly, you may need to survive long enough to find the right window.

## Which Game?

So both Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel can have different preferences regarding control versus execution and still both be right as an investor. 

As an entrepreneur, you can choose between investing in control or focusing on execution. Which is the right path is base on what kind of business you want to create. But, the worst founders switch between strategies then call it "pivot". The misunderstood dogma here is to have no definite plan, work in incremental iterations to find out what's most valuable to customers today(Lean Startup Methodology). This approach will probably lead you to very incremental solutions or even make you run around in circles achieving nothing. It lowers the cost of failure, but also the potential impact of success. The process becomes more important than the end goal. 

The real question: Run faster or jump higher?
