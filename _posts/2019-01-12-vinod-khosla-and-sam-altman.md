When you set out on a journey, your mindset determines who you bring onboard, how you approach it, what you set up, what deals you do, which investors you've got.

*90% of investors add no value. My assessment, 70% of investors add negative value to a company.*

*Just because you got an MBA and joined a venture firm doesn’t mean you’re qualified to advise an entrepreneur.*

*if somebody can do their own startup, they will. They’re not comparing them to your job. You’re comparing them to them starting their own company*

*if you don’t do that, you’re including only the people who couldn’t start their own company who won’t help you evolve your plan*.

*If you sort of say I’m maximizing the size of the pie first, then it doesn’t matter what percentage you own.*
