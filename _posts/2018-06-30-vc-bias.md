The 99% venture investment thesis needs revision. In general, they have these rules to pick good deal:

```
1. Founders/Product fit 
2. Product/Market fit 
3. Social Proof 
4. Team  
5. Progress and frequency of activity 
6. Dedication 
7. Grit/Character 
8. Past successes/failures
```

Letâ€™s take Facebook:

1. Mark Zuckerberg wasn't a particularly social guy, so his founders/product fit was nearly 0.

2. Product/market fit: Facebook was a social network just for schools, this doesn't really show any product/market fit. it's a super niche product with no obvious revenue model.

3. Founder had zero social proof. couldn't even bag any advertising clients.

4. Founder didn't get along great with team, in fact all team members sued him.

5. The very first version of the site looked and features it had in 2004 - https://www.quora.com/What-did-the-first-version-of-Facebook... does not show that much progress or activity.

6. Mark was just a Harvard student, so were the other team members, no dedicated staff at all.

7. No basis to judge.

8. No prior past experience to judge from.

Based on the above there is a 0.00% chance that most vcs will fund the next Facebook at the seed/angel stage, at any valuation. Out of 8 standards, they will have to give them a 0/8 on nearly all of them.

If you are VC, don't tell me that because they (Zuck,Jobs,Elon..) are outliners. Because whether you will become great VC(by return not retweet) or not rely on these "outliners". 99% of your investment will turn mediocre performance or failed. 

Those 1% VCs don't seek validation from their peers and the market, they form their own views. They have balls to bet unpopular things.
