# The Nature of the Game: Changing

In the game of creation, knowing how your idea evolving is more important to "have a good idea" in the long term. Because you will realize how to generate your own point of view, not just follow the trend(a game invented by other players).

**“Being right is the enemy of staying right because it leads you to forget the way the world works.” — Jason Zweig.**

This is exactly the reason why companies rise and fall. Because they learned to play one game and got good at it. But the market constantly changes to a new kind of game.

Disruption is the art of calculated risk-taking. Before you start to think something new, It’s extremely important to understand the odds of creating your own game.

So, where is the business opportunity for a startup founder? What’s the right strategy to leverage the odds of creating the game? Why Sean Parker said,[”Facebook should not have won, MySpace Blew It”?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVIhUVid4fA)

# The Window of the Game: Maintaining

**The outliners in the tech business wars are pirates(startups), not Navy Seals(incumbents).**

The current business models are actually less durable than they used to be while software are eating the world.

In fact, the opportunity exists in the business world because when companies become successful is when collective leadership becomes most focused on maintaining success. Usually, leadership tends to see more risk in the downside of the current plan and than upside in taking on new things.

Things those companies doing regularly:

1. View a temporary trend as a competitive advantage.
2. Focus on building reputational momentum.
3. Believe it’s easy to span across generations.
4. Love being right.
5. Love the new idea, not new way of thinking.
6. Love being “Data-Driven”.


Being right and staying right is totally different. Doing well reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially when those ideas conflict with your proven business model.

What makes disruption so devastating is the fact that absent a crisis, it is almost impossible to avoid. Managers are paid to leverage their advantages, not destroy them; to increase margins, not obliterate them.


# The Odds of the New Game: Creating

## Ignore Competition


“In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing. But a startup can’t do what all the other startups do. I don’t think a lot of people realize this, even in startups.

The average big company grows at about ten percent a year. So if you’re running a big company and you do everything the way the average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the average big company — that is, to grow about ten percent a year.

The same thing will happen if you’re running a startup, of course. If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. The problem here is, average performance means that you’ll go out of business.”- Paul Graham

Counterintuitively, truly transformative companies rarely fit into pre-defined boxes. Limiting focus to “yesterday’s” best-performing industries couldn’t see the new opportunities. Like I said, those business leaders who are running the show are very bad at telling you what you shouldn’t do and what should do, even they are successful.

The traditional business thinking process is like:

1. Dissect the dominant business model in your industry.
2. How big is the remaining market?
3. Find a way to get in.


Instead, in order to maximize the odds of creating your own game, you should just totally ignore “the market things...the trend...the user” and think about:

1. What’s the unique leverage other companies can’t/hard to clone? How to achieve and create that moat?
2. What’s the opportunity cost of building that moat?
3. How to maximize that leverage?


### Why ignore the user?

Because which market depend on you, not on the user. You’re not in the market the user think you’re in — you’re in the market you think you’re in. 

Most failed companies made the wrong “awesome product” by choosing the wrong market and following the wrong direction "told by the user you talked to". Most user get pitched "understandable idea" because founders think they have to prove market fit before building product depth. If your business fits in a market design by someone else, you are “default dead”. 

The real question is : Do you have a vision of the future and design a market that only you can build and dominate?

### The market-size is not as important as you think

Numbers are about the past if you wanna create new things(check the chart above - created by Bedrock Cap), you need to focus on what’s the one that can’t be copied and people don’t know they need it yet. If you thinking about the market-size, the market you are thinking about to get in is full of competitors.

Ignore competition(avoid data-driven idea).

Maximaze the odds to create your own category(game).
