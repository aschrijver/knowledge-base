Human are slowly becoming the cyborg with a supercomputer in our pocket. With the sheer amount of information available in the world today, we have become overwhelmed. Our mind is in a constant racing state.

Inspired by Ghost in the Shell, I believe the future of human thinking is to functionalize part of our thoughts to a thinking network. I think we should try to **turn our this part of thoughts into composable and functional network by starting to view everything as a function and iterate it like a machine.**
