# Ghosts in the Shell


## `Functional Flow -> Brains -> Ghosts in the Shell`

`I'm trying to decentralize my brain to a network of brains.`

Ghost in the Shell (Japanese: 攻殻機動隊 シェルのゴースト) is a 1989 Japanese media franchise originally published as a seinen manga series of the same name written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow.

In that post-cyberpunk iteration of a possible future, computer technology has advanced to the point that many members of the public possess cyberbrains, technology that allows them to interface their biological brain with various networks. The level of cyberization varies from simple minimal interfaces to almost complete replacement of the brain with cybernetic parts, in cases of severe trauma. This can also be combined with various levels of prostheses, with a fully prosthetic body enabling a person to become a cyborg.

We are still way far from that kind of individual advanced tech in 2018, though we are slowly becoming the cyborg with a supercomputer in our pocket. With the sheer amount of information available in the world today, we have become overwhelmed.

Our mind is in a constant racing state.

Inspired by Ghost in the Shell, I believe the future of human thinking is to decentralize ourselves to a thinking network like "GHOSTS in the Shell". I think we should try to turn our brain into composable and functional brains network by starting to view everything as a function and iterate it like a machine, together. (Functional Flow)

We need to elevate our mind in this digital age. Not only as a human, but also as a human + machine.


# Define Functional Flow

Functional flow is the mind state where you can think almost everything as a function. And view yourself as a functional machine.

It is all about being [Clear] + [Composable].

 ```
 Efficient (Functions)= Machine X
 
 Machine (Composable Flow) = Functional Flow
 
 ```

# Find Your Own Functions 

## First: Be Clear


> Micro problems: Death? Poor or Rich? Social status? Happiness? What's the meaning of life? 

How do you see yourself？ Are those solving your own micro problems? You need to be crystal clear on what you want to be and what kind of life you wanna live. What do you want to learn? Why?

> Macro problems: Environment, Econ...other human beings, animal, humanity...

How you view the world and why? What kind of impact do you want to create? What are the goals you wanna reach?



## Second: Be Composable

### Why should we compose functions?

> Micro: Efficiency, Survive better. Understand the world better. Avoid bias.

> Macro: Empathy, Elevate civilization of human beings. Survive better, together. Build better environment.

You need to be clear on how to achieve the goals above. Then you will figure out what’s ur input and output. 

In order to create Functional Flow in your mind, you should functionize your knowledge and how you see the world.

In order to stay in functional, you should be willing to contribute those knowledge and wisdom. in short, no selfishness.

Now you can reach the goal faster by composing other functions. 

## Why Do Functions Matter?

- Functions are a great abstraction. Looking at the input and output values gives you the complete information about the data flow. This makes functions very easy to reason about. Efficiency. 

- With the absence of side effects, you also have no unintended side effects, which plague all thoughts which modifies state.

- Functions are easily testable, they do not depend on an environment but just the function parameters.

- For the same input a function necessarily always returns the same result, this also makes reasoning about a mind behavior easier.

- As a consequence that they only depend on their inputs, functions usually are very composeable.

(Functions you input = Elements for your micro/macro goals )

(Functions you output= Impact for your macro/micro world )

# Find Your Own Flow 

## Why Do Flow Matter? 

Flow isn’t like appearance or success that other people get to rate. It’s more like happiness or curiosity, like creativity.

Flow, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.

In short, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting loss in one's sense of space and time.

The “flow experience” is defined by psychology professor Mihály Csíkszentmihályi by six factors:

   1. Intense and focused concentration on the present moment
   2. Merging of action and awareness
   3. A loss of reflective self-consciousness
   4. A sense of personal control over the situation or activity
   5. A distortion of temporal experience, one’s subjective experience of time is altered
   6. Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience 

Again, functional flow is the mind state where you can think almost everything as a function.

In Functional Flow theory, building a functional flow system is all about two stages: 

* Clearity and efficiency 

* Flow and composition


# A Clear and Efficient Machine 


We need to see things purely.


#### Being Clear

> The most basic definition of clarity is:
> 
> The clarity level between input and output.


Back to the 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci simply watched, noted, and contextualized things as he saw fit. It wasn’t like he was intentionally studying science one day and art another. To him, they were one and the same thing. They danced together, and it wasn’t possible to understand one without the other.


#### Being Efficient


> The most basic definition of efficiency is:
> 
> The ratio between input and output.

In the book < The systems approach, Dell Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1968 >, we can view an organization as an organic system, instead of blindly following the traditional lines of a division the management scientist turns to basic "missions" or "jobs" or "activities". 

All these three terms are used to describe the same kind of thing, namely, the rational breakdown of the tasks the system must perform. This is a mission-oriented view of the components of a system that is completely different from the traditional view. 

#### Clear(Efficient)= Machine X

Clear efficiency is looking around one's functional flow to discover if, and in that case - where? When? Why?, inefficiency occurs. These inefficiency can be for example idle idea(output), idle information(input) or idle functions. A good functional flow owner should then do his/her/their best to eliminate these inefficiency. All of this in order to reduce the total cost of operations of the functional flow system.

The philosophy behind the efficiency approach to functional flow is based the idea of "the one best way for yourself", i.e., the best way to input information, compute/compose functions, perform tasks, output value as a balanced human being.

If you time every single step and motion, and then carefully design the steps of the task to minimize the time, the system will perform in the best possible way.

**This approach leads toward automation of the operations. If we know the optimal way, the only way, we also know how to design a machine or robot to perform the same task.** 

Some humanists might be horrified by this, fearing the result will be degradation of one' human dignity and neglect of deeper human values.

I will explain why "flow" and "composition" will easily ease those concerns later. 

Just like the way Leonardo da Vinci see how the world works: They are dancing together.

# A Composable Flow in the Shell

We need to see things and compose things purely, just like composing functions.

> The most basic definition of Functional Flow is:
> 
> The ratio of function composition between input and output.



#### Machine (Composable Flow) = Functional Flow

> Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.

Although the word "function" has been defined in many ways, everyone will agree that a function can be a set of functions coordinated to output a set of value. 

The flow state isn’t like appearance or success that other people get to rate. It’s more like happiness or curiosity, like creativity.

Functional Flow is the mind state where you can view almost everything as a function. You can take another person's functions (thinking models, paths...) as the input of your function (also could be the input of other people's function). If you want to, after composing, you can also take that as your input again.

In some way, you can say it's like **composing people’s thinking models(including yours) and iterate it like a machine**.

That's why Functional Flow is all about composing and iterating like GHOSTS in the shell. 

Ghosts as a whole, in the powerful machine.
