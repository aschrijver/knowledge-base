# `Ghosts in the Shell (In Process)`


This is an experiental psychology project. I'm trying to functionalize my thinking to a network of brains.

We are slowly becoming the cyborg with a supercomputer in our pocket. With the sheer amount of information available in the world today, we have become overwhelmed. Our mind is in a constant racing state.

Inspired by Ghost in the Shell, I believe the future of human thinking is to decentralize ourselves to a thinking network like "GHOSTS in the Shell". I think we should try to **turn our brain into composable and functional brains network by starting to view everything as a function and iterate it like a machine**, together.
