# Life


I admire wild animals because they hunt, they fight, no matter what, they find a way to predate and survive(the best and fullest expression of themselves).

人類文明就是建立在恐懼之後的嚮往。

Emotions can override any level of intelligence. Confidence rises faster than ability.

It’s easy to do the right thing for people you like. It’s easy to do the right thing when it’s cheap. It really only matters when it’s difficult.

Whenever people say "X is too old for you", it mean they lost their dream and want you to give up yours too. The people that want to make changes in their own lives but are too scared to do anything that are the biggest haters. Second biggest group is just insecure people. - **Allen Lee**

"The first thing an animal is taught is how to find food and water. I don't get how having this knowledge and skills makes us primitive, yet not knowing any of it somehow makes us civilized" - **Kimi Werner**

“The largest illusion is the illusion of meaning that anything actually matters”. We’re all going to die, and everything will turn to dust. 


Humans are highly memetic creatures – we tend to copy what everybody else is doing, including our desires
Very often, you get trapped in the wrong game because you’re competing.

Generally, most people will make the mistake of paying too much attention to the competition and being too much like the competition and not being authentic enough.

The best way to escape competition is to just be authentic to yourself.- **Naval**

“You have got to be willing to be poor [as an entrepreneur],” he says. “There was a time when I was living out of a single suitcase. I had a rule that I wouldn’t stay on one person’s couch for more than two weeks because I didn’t want to become a bother.”

You've got to be willing to make sacrifices if you want to chase your dreams. A lot of people don't fully grasp that when they are coming in.-**Sean Parker**

The simple act of paying attention can take you a long way.

Money doesn't mean anything to me. I've made a lot of money, but I want to enjoy life and not stress myself building my bank account. I give lots away and live simply, mostly out of a suitcase in hotels. We all know that good health is much more important. -**Keanu Reeves**

The intellectual question that I ask at the start of my book is, “Tell me something that’s true that very few people agree with you on.” This is a terrific interview question. Even when people can read on the Internet that you’re going to ask this question to everybody you interview, they still find it really hard to answer. And it’s hard to answer not because people don’t have any ideas. Everyone has ideas. Everyone has things they believe to be true that other people won’t agree with you on. But they’re not things you want to say. - **Peter Thiel**

---

We are part of this universe; we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in us.-**Neil deGrasse Tyson**

It’s very hard to get the non-consensus/right results unless you’re willing to take risks and take on the non-consensus/wrong results. But people just emotionally can’t handle the non-consensus/wrong outcomes and will do nearly anything to avoid them (no matter how much we understand the above) -**Marc Andreessen**-



# Friends

No matter who you are, you need two kinds of friends in your life. The first kind is one you can call when something good happens, and you need someone who will be excited for you. Not a fake excitement veiling envy, but a real excitement. You need someone who will actually be more excited for you than he would be if it had happened to him. The second kind of friend is somebody you can call when things go horribly wrong—when your life is on the line and you only have one phone call. Who is it going to be? -**Ben Horowitz**
