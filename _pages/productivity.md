# Grit

"There are two types of people...and the people who build something are the who ones make everything happen." - **Sam Altman**

One of my concerns of our generation is that we’re talking too much and not building enough.


The hard problems you solve now will become your competitive moat in the future. -**Allen Lee**

To do unreasonable things requires unreasonable commitments and sacrifices -the keys to success aren’t secret, they’re just painful. It’s all about deferring immediate gratification for delayed gratification.

The immunity from what other people think is what leads people to be unreasonably successful- **Keith Rabios**

I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking “huh, so that’s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.” 

Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it’s perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success. 

If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don’t second guess it.

A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.

People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.-**Sam Altman**


# Learning

The best way to learn is a project, so come up with an app idea to make, then look up what you want to do as you go along (don’t worry about doing things the wrong way, that’s the best way to understand why that’s the wrong way)


The best way of learning is doing it every day, even if you think you don’t have time. - **Allen Lee**

"Leap and the net will appear" -**Kamal Ravikant**


# Productivity

"I don't have a laptop, no, I do everything on my phone. It was important to me because I turn off my notifications, and for me it's one application at a time. So I just have one app up, and I can really focus on what's in front of me instead of everything coming at me as I would a laptop." -**Jack Dorsey**




# Calm

The things that we understand, create Silence.

The bigger the ego, the more vulnerable we are.


The things that we do not, create Emotion.-**[Siddha Performance](https://mobile.twitter.com/KapilGuptaMD/status/1009192047805333516)**



# Health

If you understand the principles of nutrition (how and why we store fat, what excess amounts of seed oils/sugar do, etc.), your food choices take care of themselves.

Stop worrying about things that won’t matter a year from now. We as humans have a tendency to assign importance in the present moment to things that actually don’t really matter in the grand scheme of things. - **Jocko Willink**
