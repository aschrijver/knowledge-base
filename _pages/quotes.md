# Life


I like wild animals because they hunt, they fight, no matter what, they find a way to predate and survive. 

人類文明就是建立在恐懼之後的嚮往。

“The largest illusion is the illusion of meaning that anything actually matters”. We’re all going to die, and everything will turn to dust. - **Naval**

“You have got to be willing to be poor [as an entrepreneur],” he says. “There was a time when I was living out of a single suitcase. I had a rule that I wouldn’t stay on one person’s couch for more than two weeks because I didn’t want to become a bother.”

You've got to be willing to make sacrifices if you want to chase your dreams. A lot of people don't fully grasp that when they are coming in.-**Sean Parker**

---

The simple act of paying attention can take you a long way.

Money doesn't mean anything to me. I've made a lot of money, but I want to enjoy life and not stress myself building my bank account. I give lots away and live simply, mostly out of a suitcase in hotels. We all know that good health is much more important. -**Keanu Reeves**

The intellectual question that I ask at the start of my book is, “Tell me something that’s true that very few people agree with you on.” This is a terrific interview question. Even when people can read on the Internet that you’re going to ask this question to everybody you interview, they still find it really hard to answer. And it’s hard to answer not because people don’t have any ideas. Everyone has ideas. Everyone has things they believe to be true that other people won’t agree with you on. But they’re not things you want to say. - **Peter Thiel**

---

We are part of this universe; we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in us.-**Neil deGrasse Tyson**



# Grit

"There are two types of people...and the people who build something are the who ones make everything happen." - **Sam Altman**

To do unreasonable things requires unreasonable commitments and sacrifices -the keys to success aren’t secret, they’re just painful. It’s all about deferring immediate gratification for delayed gratification.

The immunity from what other people think is what leads people to be unreasonably successful- **Keith Rabios**

---

I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking “huh, so that’s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.” 

Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it’s perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success. 

If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don’t second guess it.

A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.

People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.-**Sam Altman**


# Startup

This is a game about execution not ideas. **Allen Lee**

I do startups because I have a problem communicating my ideas in a way to influence larger organizations to do the things that interest me. Simple as that. - **[buf-HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=buf)**

“To me, there is no such thing as a mistimed company. The founder’s job is to triangulate to what’s possible…You need to plan for what’s possible today and figure out hacks.”


Startup CEOs should not play the odds. When you are building a company, you must believe there is an answer and you cannot pay attention to your odds of finding it. You just have to find it. It matters not whether your chances are nine in ten or one in a thousand; your task is the same. -**Ben Horowitz**

---

Risk is always proportionate to reward. The way to get really big returns is to do things that seem crazy, like starting a new search engine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar acquisition offer.

This has traditionally been a problem in venture funding. Founders and investors have different attitudes to risk. Knowing that risk is on average proportionate to reward, investors like risky strategies, while founders, who don't have a big enough sample size to care what's true on average, tend to be more conservative. - **Paul Graham**

“What I like to talk to my team about is that I’m short term impatient. I want the small ideas that will take a week.

And I’m longterm patient. I’ll listen to the big ideas that take 5 years.

I don’t like the in between.

So if there is a small idea. Get it to me. Get it launched in a month. Get it launched in two weeks. I’ll take that. I’ll also take the big long terms bets.

Don’t come to me with anything in between.”- **Dara Khosrowshahi**

I am one of those people who believe that having a scarcity brings out the best in a company and really focuses you on what is core to the company and then you execute better.- **[Sarah Tavel](https://www.recode.net/2018/2/22/17042584/transcript-benchmark-partner-sarah-tavel-venture-capital-recode-decode)**


---

The mobile app stores, in particular, have always seemed to me to be a constraint on innovation vs a contributor to it.-**Fred Wilson**



# Network Effect

The existence of a durable network effect can overcome a lot of potential flaws in a product or business, and conversely the absence of network effects cannot be solved by features or clever customer acquisition strategies.-**Mitch Lasky**



# Learning

The best way to learn is a project, so come up with an app idea to make, then look up what you want to do as you go along (don’t worry about doing things the wrong way, that’s the best way to understand why that’s the wrong way)


The best way of learning is doing it every day, even if you think you don’t have time. - **Allen Lee**

# Friends

No matter who you are, you need two kinds of friends in your life. The first kind is one you can call when something good happens, and you need someone who will be excited for you. Not a fake excitement veiling envy, but a real excitement. You need someone who will actually be more excited for you than he would be if it had happened to him. The second kind of friend is somebody you can call when things go horribly wrong—when your life is on the line and you only have one phone call. Who is it going to be? -**Ben Horowitz**



# Dev Management 

What many people complain that their Developer is bad, is mostly because of lack of business process and communicating clearly to the dev. Many small businesses still operate with the mindset that throw requirements to the other side and get back fully working bug free code which rarely works.-**HN User**

# Productivity

"I don't have a laptop, no, I do everything on my phone. It was important to me because I turn off my notifications, and for me it's one application at a time. So I just have one app up, and I can really focus on what's in front of me instead of everything coming at me as I would a laptop." -**Jack Dorsey**


# AI, Intelligence

“I think an artificial general intelligence (AGI) is much more likely to be an emerging property of the internet rather than something we create in a lab”  – **Naval**



# Calm

The things that we understand, create Silence.

The bigger the ego, the more vulnerable we are.


The things that we do not, create Emotion.-**[Siddha Performance](https://mobile.twitter.com/KapilGuptaMD/status/1009192047805333516)**
