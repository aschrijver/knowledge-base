# Startup

This is a game about execution not ideas. **Allen Lee**

I do startups because I have a problem communicating my ideas in a way to influence larger organizations to do the things that interest me. Simple as that. - **[buf-HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=buf)**

“To me, there is no such thing as a mistimed company. The founder’s job is to triangulate to what’s possible…You need to plan for what’s possible today and figure out hacks.”


Startup CEOs should not play the odds. When you are building a company, you must believe there is an answer and you cannot pay attention to your odds of finding it. You just have to find it. It matters not whether your chances are nine in ten or one in a thousand; your task is the same. -**Ben Horowitz**

Risk is always proportionate to reward. The way to get really big returns is to do things that seem crazy, like starting a new search engine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar acquisition offer.

This has traditionally been a problem in venture funding. Founders and investors have different attitudes to risk. Knowing that risk is on average proportionate to reward, investors like risky strategies, while founders, who don't have a big enough sample size to care what's true on average, tend to be more conservative. - **Paul Graham**

“What I like to talk to my team about is that I’m short term impatient. I want the small ideas that will take a week.

And I’m longterm patient. I’ll listen to the big ideas that take 5 years.

I don’t like the in between.

So if there is a small idea. Get it to me. Get it launched in a month. Get it launched in two weeks. I’ll take that. I’ll also take the big long terms bets.

Don’t come to me with anything in between.”- **Dara Khosrowshahi**

I am one of those people who believe that having a scarcity brings out the best in a company and really focuses you on what is core to the company and then you execute better.- **[Sarah Tavel](https://www.recode.net/2018/2/22/17042584/transcript-benchmark-partner-sarah-tavel-venture-capital-recode-decode)**

The mobile app stores, in particular, have always seemed to me to be a constraint on innovation vs a contributor to it.-**Fred Wilson**

“Nest would never have happened if I didn’t get out of the echo chamber of Silicon Valley,”-**Tony Fadell**

The job of the CEO is to make hard decisions without the support of data, and have the confidence and communication skills to get the company to commit. -**Sam Altman**



# Network Effect

The existence of a durable network effect can overcome a lot of potential flaws in a product or business, and conversely the absence of network effects cannot be solved by features or clever customer acquisition strategies.-**Mitch Lasky**


# Venture Capital

The best investments look bad but are good.

Similarly, many investments look good but are bad. The easiest way to fool me is with a nice growth graph and an idea that sounds good, but most investors have their weak spots. Another trap that a lot of investors fall for is bad founders with impressive credentials.-**Sam Altman**




# Product Management 

What many people complain that their Developer is bad, is mostly because of lack of business process and communicating clearly to the dev. Many small businesses still operate with the mindset that throw requirements to the other side and get back fully working bug free code which rarely works.-**HN User**


You don’t change industries by telling people to change, you change them by making the alternative more profitable.-**Kamal Ravikant**




# AI, Intelligence

“I think an artificial general intelligence (AGI) is much more likely to be an emerging property of the internet rather than something we create in a lab”  – **Naval**
