I didn't actually notice. Hopefully it is now fixed.

Very informative and interesting. However, I operate using a text based Browser.
I would be very nice if the whole caboodle was packaged up as a pdf file an 
the reader given the option to download.
Thanks for the work, Vin
PS If it does become available, could you email me at v.p.crabtree@brad.ac.uk \
and I will download it.

I lost my copy of this almost 15 years ago 
in a lost crate of such treasures.
I am pleased to find this timeless work of rocketry again
 and my hearty applause to your posting on the WEB.
 thanks !            mpowers8@pacific.net.sg

researching for the proper technique to bild this tipe of engine, and now we
have a great starting point. i must confess i never thought i would find such
complete information on the subject.

calculation and DC (drag coeficient) calculation?
